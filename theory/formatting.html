<h2>Comments and Formatting</h2>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>
Throughout the examples, I will make use of the handy comment feature of Dart.
Comments are a way to indicate that certain parts of the program aren't
instructions, but commentary in text form. When something is indicated to be a
comment, Dart will skip that part when executing the program.
</p><p>
There are 2 kinds of comments: line comments and block comments. As the name
suggests, line comments span a single line, and they start from two slashes
'<code>//</code>'. Block comments on the other hand can span as many lines as
you want, and they are started with <code>/*</code> and ended with
<code>*/</code>. Note how in the example below, the text that is commented is
greyed out to indicate it's not part of the actual code of the program.
</p><dart>
main() {
  int a = 5;
  // this is a line comment, it ends at the end of this line
  int b = 4;

  //int b = 4;
  // notice how the code is also grey, because it is commented out
  print(a + b);
  /* this is a block comment, so this line is also commented out
    this is very useful to quickly disable a big batch of code,
    or for longer explanations. I will use this to point out that
    text comments often have a space after the slashes, but commented
    code does not.
  */
  print(a - b);
}
</dart>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>
I also want to tackle the subject of formatting right at the start. With
formatting, I mean the way in which you decide to structure your code visually.
In C-like languages ,which includes Dart, whitespace characters are almost
always ignored when the program is executed, so using spaces, tabs and separate
lines are for aesthetics and keeping the code readable. That said, making your
code readable is important, and not following the common ways to format your
code is a surefire way to make other programmers dislike you :P .
</p><p>
Here are some patterns of code and the most commonly accepted way to write
them; once you learn a new thing you can come back to check how most people
tend to write them. My own style that all the examples are written in is very
close to the standard, except from a few left out spaces here and there for
brevity's sake.
</p><dart>
main() {
  // no space between the function name and bracket,
  // but a space between the bracket and curly brace

  int myVariable = 5;
  // everything between curly braces is indented 2 more spaces
  // than those brackets
  // variables are not capitalised, but variable names consisting of
  // multiple words are glued together with a capital
  // (this is called camel case)

  if(myVariable == 7) {
    // I tend to add a space between the 'if' and the bracket,
    // to make them look different from functions

    print("very good!");
    // extra curly braces, so we move 2 more spaces!
  } else {
    int a = (4 + 9) * 2;
    // all operators have a space on either side,
    // but not the semicolon or the brackets
  }

  // we ended the brackets of the 'if else', so we go 2 spaces back
  List<int> myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  // commas have a space after but not before them
}

class Tile {
  int? x;
  int? y;
  //variables are declared on a separate line, even when very short

  Tile(this.x, this.y);
  // the usual order in a class is:
  // first fields, then constructors, and functions last
  
  bool isBlack() { return (x + y)?.isEven(); }
  // if a function is very short, you can put it on one line
}
</dart>
