<h2>Formatting</h2>
<p>
I also want to tackle the subject of formatting right at the start. With
formatting, I mean the way in which you decide to structure your code 
visually. In all C-like languages (which includes Dart) most
whitespace characters are ignored when the program is executed, so using spaces
and tabs are mostly for aesthetics. That said, making your code readable is
important, and not following the common ways to format your code is a surefire
way to make other programmers dislike you :P.
</p><p>
Here are some patterns of code and the most commonly accepted way to write them; once you learn a new thing you can come back to check how most people tend to write them. My own
style that all the examples are written in is very close to the standard,
except from a few left out spaces here and there for brevity's sake.
</p><dart>
main() {
  // no space between the function name and bracket,
  // but a space between the bracket and curly brace

  int myVariable = 5;
  // everything between curly braces is indented 2 more spaces
  // than those brackets
  // variables are not capitalised, but variable names consisting of
  // multiple words are glued together with a capital
  // (this is called camel case)

  if(myVariable == 7) {
    // I tend to add a space between the 'if' and the bracket,
    // to make them look different from functions

    print("very good!");
    // extra curly braces, so we move 2 more spaces!
  } else {
    int a = (4 + 9) * 2;
    // all operators have a space on either side,
    // but not the semicolon or the brackets
  }

  // we ended the brackets of the 'if else', so we go 2 spaces back
  List<int> myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  // commas have a space after but not before them
}

class Tile {
  int? x;
  int? y;
  //variables are declared on a separate line, even when very short

  Tile(this.x, this.y);
  // the usual order in a class is:
  // first fields, then constructors, and functions last
  
  bool isBlack() { return (x + y)?.isEven(); }
  // if a function is very short, you can put it on one line
}
</dart>
