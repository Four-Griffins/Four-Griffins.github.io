<h2>Variables and Expressions</h2>
<p>
Before we start calculating things, we first need to learn how to create data
to perform the calculations on. This is done with <span class='themable
class'>variables</span>, a concept that exists in every single programming
language there is. Let's take a look at an example.
</p><dart>
main() {
  int amountOfLegs = 2;
  print(amountOfLegs);

  amountOfLegs = 4;
  print(amountOfLegs);
}
</dart><div class='themable remark'>
Remember, if a variable name is multiple words, they are glued together, and
the first word is lowercase while the rest is uppercase. so "amount of legs"
becomes "<span style='color: #55b'>a</span>mount<span style='color: #b44'>O</span>f<span style='color: #b44'>L</span>egs".
</div><p>
There are 4 statements in this code. In the first one, we create a variable named <code>amountOfLegs</code> and give it a value
of 2. Note that in programming, a single = sign means assigning a value to a
variable, and the variable is always on the left while the value is on the
right. After printing our variable, we give it a new value and then print it again. If you try this code on Dartpad, you will notice that the 2 <code>print</code> statements will produce the values 2 and 4 respectively.
</p>
<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>
In some languages, that's where the story ends: you create variables by giving
them a name, and a value. Those languages are called dynamically typed. But
Dart, like many other languages, is statically typed, which means that whenever
you create a variable, you have to specify what type of data it stores, and you
can only store values of that type. In the example above, this is done with the
word <code class='themable class'>int</code>. This specifies that
<code>amountOfLegs</code> can store integervalues (integers are whole numbers).
Let's take this code as an example:
</p><dart>
main() {
  int amountOfLegs = "hello";
  int count = 4.3;
}
</dart><p>
Dart would refuse to run this code, because <code class='themable
string'>"hello"</code> is a <code class='themable class'>String</code>, and
<code>amountOfLegs</code> only accepts values of type <code class='themable
class'>int</code>. Similarly, <code>count</code> would fail, because <code
class='themable literal'>4.3</code> is not an <code class='themable
class'>int</code>.
</p><p>
So what types are there? Well, there are a few built-in types that we can use.
<ul>
  <li><code class='themable class'>int</code>, which stores integer values like
    <code class='themable literal'>47</code>, <code class='themable
      literal'>-905</code> and <code class='themable literal'>0</code>.</li>
  <li><code class='themable class'>double</code>, which can store floating
    point values like <code class='themable literal'>3.14</code>. Its name is
    derived from the fact that it takes twice as much memory space to store a
  single value compared to the <code class='themable class'>int</code>.</li>
  <li><code class='themable class'>bool</code>, wich stores exactly 2 possible
  values: <code class='themable literal'>true</code> and <code class='themable
literal'>false</code>. These are used to create conditions, in case you only
want to run code in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<code class='themable class'>String</code>s are actually not a standard type;
you can tell because its name starts with a capital, unlike the others I
mentioned. <code class='themable class'>String</code> is actually a class. We
will learn more about classes later, but in short, they are types that you can
create yourself, so you can store any kind of data you want. Just like the
<code>print</code> function, the <code class='themable class'>String</code>
class is provided by Dart automatically.
</p>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>
Now we know that assigning variables works in the following pattern:
<dart> <name> = <value>; </dart>
But the &lt;value> part is a lot more flexible than just typing an actual
value. You can put anything you want there, as long as it can ultimately be
resolved to a single value of the right type. For example, you can put a long
calculation there.
<dart>
main() {
  double a = (4 + 3) * 7.7 / 2.5 + 15;
}
</dart>
This whole calculation can be reduced to a single floating-point number, so
Dart will perform the calculation and assign the result to <code>a</code>. Even
better, we can also use variables in those calculations:
<dart>
main() {
  int x = 4;
  int y = 2 * x + 5; // results to y = 13
}
</dart>
Expressions also exist for other types, outside numbers. Here are some examples:
<dart>
main() {
  String greeting = "Hello" + "world" + "!";
  print(greeting); // Helloworld!

  bool finished = true && ((false || true) != true);
  print(finished); // false
}
</dart>
</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>
The curly braces of functions have another use, besides grouping together parts
of code. They also define a <b>scope</b>. A scope is an environment, in which
certain variables are valid and can be used. When you define a variable, it is
bound to the nearest scope that it is in, so if you define a variable in the
main function, you can use it in the main function. However, scopes stack, so
if you create a scope within a scope, you can use variables in the outer scope
from within the inner scope - but not the other way around!
<dart>
main() {
  String a = "outer";
  print(a);

  {
    // we can create a scope by adding these braces.
    // it's not very useful, but you can do it if you need to

    print(a);
    // a is valid here, it's frome the scope around this one

    String b = "inner";
    print(b);
    // we can use b here, it's in the same scope as where it's created

  } // &lt;-- the inner scope ends here, b is no longer valid to use

  print(b);
  // error! We can't use b here, it's not defined in this scope
}
</dart>
</p>
