<h2>Null Safety</h2>
<p>
If you ever tried putting this code into Dart:
<dart>
main() {
  int num;
  print(num + 2);
}
</dart>
you will have noticed that by default, Dart gives you an error, saying that
"non-nullable values must be assigned before they can be used". Apart from the
word 'non-nullable' this makes intuitive sense; we can't really print the
contents of <code class='themable variable'>a</code> if <code class='themable
variable'>a</code> doesn't contain anything, so most languages are made in such
a way that you can never have an 'empty' variable the moment you want to use
it. But it hasn't always been like that. Almost any programming language
created before the year 2000 (including C, C++, C#, Java and even early
versions of Dart) had a special value that could be assigned to any kind of
variable: <code class='themable literal'>null</code>. This value meant that the
variable is empty, and all new variables would get assigned <code
class='themable literal'>null</code> by default unless you specifically give
them a value.
</p><p>
The obvious problem with this is, of course, what happens if you try to use a
variable set to <code class='themable literal'>null</code>? There is no way to
add 2 to nothing like I am trying in the example, so Dart will simply refuse to
run this code. This is actually a good idea: imagine if Dart didn't warn you
about this, and you are writing a program of hundreds of lines of code, and
somewhere in it you accidentally forgot to initialise a variable. It would take
ages to find the problem, and debugging would be very frustrating.
</p><p>
However, sometimes it makes sense to have a variable that may or may not be
empty. For example, imagine a turn based game where players can skip their
turn. You could represent skipped turns by the value <code class='themable
literal'>null</code>. Or, use <code class='themable literal'>null</code> to
represent the empty squares when making a chess board. To achieve this, Dart
provides <b><i>nullable types</i></b>.
<dart>
class Rectangle {
  double? width;
  double? height;
}
</dart>
Here, the type of <code class='themable variable'>x</code> and <code
  class='themable variable'>y</code> is not <code class='themable
  class'>double</code>, but <code class='themable class'>double?</code>. The only
difference is that <code class='themable class'>double?</code> is allowed to
contain <code class='themable literal'>null</code>, whereas <code
class='themable class'>double</code> is not. This means that the above code, where
we don't initialize <code class='themable variable'>x</code> and <code
class='themable variable'>y</code> is valid, because Dart will set them to
<code class='themable literal'>null</code> by default. However, be careful when
using these variables, you have make sure they aren't <code class='themable
literal'>null</code> before using them!
<dart>
class Rectangle {
  double? width;
  double? height;

  double? length() {
    if (width != null && height != null) {
      return width! * height!;
    }
  }
}
</dart>
Did you notice the exclamation marks behind <code class='themable
  variable'>width</code> and <code class='themable variable'>height</code>?
This is a special operator called the null assert operator. It can be used to
turn a nullable variable in a non-nullable variable, by returning the value if
the variable is not <code class='themable literal'>null</code>... and crashing
the program if it is. So yes, it's still important to make sure the variables
you're using aren't <code class='themable literal'>null</code>.
</p>
<h3>The null-aware operaors</h3>
<p>
However, there are a few more operators that allow us to more easily work with
nullable variables. For example, let's say that you want to do something wit a
value, but if it is <code class='themable literal'>null</code>, there should be
a default value in it's place. This can be achieved like this:
<dart>
main() {
  int? a = null;
  int b = a ?? 2; // b is now 2
}
</dart>
Accessing a property or function of an instance will crash if the instance is
<code class='themable literal'>null</code>. Luckily we don't have to put an
entire <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> check around it, because there
is a shorthand:
<dart>
bert?.sayHello();
// if bert is not null, sayHello will run,
// else nothing will happen

//these can even be chained!
print(bert?.father?.address?.streetNumber ?? -1)
// this will print the street number of bert's father,
// but if anything in the chain is null, it will default to -1
</dart>
And last but not least, Dart has a variant of the assign operator that only
works if the variable is <code class='themable literal'>null</code>.
<dart>
int? a;
int? b = 4;
a ??= 2; // a is null, so 2 gets assigned
b ??= 2; // b already has a vallue so it gets skipped

print(a); // output is 2
print(b); // output is 4
</dart>
</p>
