<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>
With the use of loops, we can dynamically change how many instructions we
execute. But instructions are only half of the story: what about data? Well of
course there is a way to store dynamic amounts of data. Several ways even, and
each of them has its own use case. But by far the most simple one is the <code
                                                                             class='themable
                                                                             class'>List</code>
class.
</p><p>
The <code class='themable class'>List</code> class is slightly different from
the classes we talked about so far. See, in Dart, all variables need to have a
datatype - as we already discussed before. So if you create a list. you need to
explicitly say that it's a <code class='themable class'>List</code>. But what
about the values that you store in the list? They are also variables, so they
need to have a type too! To solve this issue, Dart makes use of an advanced
concept called <i>generic types</i>. Generic types are a bit too complicated to
explain now, but all you need to know now is how <code class='themable
class'>List</code> uses them to define the datatype of the class.
<dart>
List<int> ages = [18, 22, 34, 70, 12];
</dart>
Look at the angled brackets: those are to indicate what type the list will
store. In this case, it's a list of <code class='themable
class'>int</code>s.<br/>
Then we create a new list. Just like with <code class='themable
class'>String</code>, a <code class='themable class'>List</code> has a literal
notation, so you don't need to use <code class='themable
class'>List</code><code class='themable operator'>()</code>. (It's technically
possible, but don't use it, it's not recommended.)<br/> List literals use
square brackets, followed by a list of items separated by commas. These items
are optional - you can create an empty list with <code class='themable
operator'>[]</code> - but evey item needs to be of the correct type, of course.
Dart also doesn't care if there is a "trailing comma", an unnecessary comma
after the last item in the list. This is useful for quickly copypasting code.
<dart>
main() {
  List<bool> empty = [];
  List<String> generated = [
    "long string number 1",
    "long string number 2",
    "long string number 3",
    "long string number 4",
    "long string number 5",
    "long string number 6",
  ];
}
</dart>
I just copypasted those strings and changed the number, without removing the
redundant comma after the last string. Dart is smart enough to ignore it. Be
careful though, a lot of languages don't do this!
</p>
<h3>Accessing a List</h3>
<p>
Accessing the items in a list is done like this:
<dart>
main() {
  List<String> numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four"];
  String third = numbers[3];
  print(third);
}
</dart>
Once more we use square brackets, they are the typical sign of working with
lists. Be careful though: the code above will output <code>three</code> because
in programming languages, counting starts at 0. (In the list above, the
elements are named after what place they are in.) This might seem
counterintuitive at first, but decades of programming have shown that a lot of
code can be made simpler if lists start at 0, so the majority of programming
languages stick with that.
</p><p>
This also means that using the length of the list as an index is invalid: the
list in the example has a length of 5, but the highest valid index is 4, so 1
less than that. It is always true that the indices of the list range from 0 up
to <b>but not including</b> the length of the list.
</p><p>
This is a good question though, what happens if you use an invalid index? Well,
that will once more make the program crash. Interestingly, in the popular
scripting language Python it's possible to use a negative index too, in which
case the list will start counting from the tail end. But even then you need to
make sure the index is larger than the inverse of the length.
</p>
<h3>Useful Functions of Lists</h3>
<p>
How do we get this length, I hear you ask? Very simple: through the <code
class='themable variable'>length</code> property of <code class='themable
class'>List</code>. And while we're at it, let's take a look at some other
useful functions that <code class='themable class'>List</code> offers us.
<dart>
main() {
  List<int> numbers = [2, 7, 4, 5, 1];

  print(numbers.length);        // 5
  print(numbers.sublist(1, 4));  // [7, 4, 5]
  print(numbers.reversed));     // [1, 5, 4, 7, 2]
  print(numbers.first);         // 2
  print(numbers.last);          // 1
  print(numbers.isEmpty);       // false
  print(numbers.contains(7));   // true
  print(numbers.indexOf(7));    // 1
  print(numbers.join("--"));    // 2--7--4--5--1
  /* Okay, this one needs some explanation. join() takes all elements in the
     list, converts them to strings, and pastes them together with the given
     string in between.
  */

  numbers.remove(5);
  print(numbers);       // [2, 7, 4, 1]
  numbers.removeAt(1);
  print(numbers);       // [2, 4, 1]
  numbers.add(19);
  print(numbers);       // [2, 4, 1, 19]
  numbers.insert(2, 50);
  print(numbers);       // [2, 4, 50, 1, 19]
  numbers.sort();
  print(numbers);       // [1, 2, 4, 19, 50]
  numbers.clear();
  print(numbers);       // []
}
</dart>
Phew, that's a lot! But don't worry about it, you don't need to know these, we
will repeat them one at a time the moment we need them. This is just to show
that <code class='themable class'>List</code> is filled with nice
quality-of-life features.
</p>
<h3><code class='themable keyword'>for</code> Loops</h3>
<p>
Now that you know about lists, it's time to explain the other type of loop
apart from the <code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop. The first way
to use it is like this.
<dart>
for (<instruction>; <condition>; <instruction>) {
  <code>
}
</dart>
This looks complicated, so let's break it down. The first instruction is
executed once, right before the loop starts. The condition after that is
evaluated at the beginning of every iteration, in exactly the same way that a
<code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop evaluates its condition. Then
the block of code is run, and after that the last instruction is run, at the
end of every iteration. This seems very strange and arbitrary, but the <code
class='themable keyword'>for</code> loop was invented for a very specific use
case: looping over all the values in a list.
<dart>
main() {
  List<String> numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];

  for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    String current = numbers[i];
    print(current);
  }
}
</dart>
First, we create the variable <code class='themable variable'>i</code>. Why is
it called <code class='themable variable'>i</code>? Well, it's just a
convention to call variables you create in a <code class='themable
keyword'>for</code> loop like that. You can decide to give it a more meaningful
name within the context - like <code class='themable variable'>number</code> -
but most programmers are lazy and will just use <code class='themable
variable'>i</code>.
</p><p>
The condition here is checking if <code class='themable variable'>i</code>
stays strictly smaller than the list length, because as I said before, the
length itself is no longer a valid index.  And lastly, at the end of every loop
we do <code class='themable variable'>i</code><code class='themable
  operator'>++</code>. This is an operator that adds 1 to a variable, so it's
just shorthand for <code>i = i + 1</code>.
</p><p>
All in all, that code does exactly the same thing as the following:
<dart>
main() {
  List<String> numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];

  int i = 0;
  while (i < numbers.length) {
    String current = numbers[i];
    print(current);
    i++;
  }
}
</dart>
In fact, for anything even slightly more complex than this use case, you should
definitely use a <code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop. Sure, the
<code class='themable keyword'>for</code> is shorter, but it's also a lot less
readable, and in a few months you will get angry at your past self for doing this.
</p>
<h3>Foreach Loops</h3>
The real power of the <code class='themable keyword'>for</code> loop comes with
the so-called <code>foreach</code>-loop. It's called this way because in Java
(who was the first to introduce it) it used a special keyword, <code
class='themable keyword'>foreach</code>, to separate it from the classic <code
class='themable keyword'>for</code>.  Foreach loops are a much more elegant way
to access the values of a list.
<dart>
main() {
  List<String> numbers = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];

  for (String i in numbers) {
    print(i);
  }
}
</dart>
This is much cleaner, isn't it? Note how last time <code class='themable
variable'>i</code> was an <code class='themable class'>int</code>, but now it's
a <code class='themable class'>String</code>, because in foreach loops, the
index loops over the actual values in the list, and not just their positions.
Since <code class='themable variable'>numbers</code> is a list of <code
            class='themable class'>String</code>s, <code class='themable
variable'>i</code> has to be a <code class='themable class'>String</code>.
</p>
