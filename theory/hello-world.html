<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>
Every programmer has to start somewhere, and it's a tradition to start at a
program that prints the text "hello, world!" to the console.  So let's start by
looking at how such a program would be made in Dart.
</p>
<dart>
main() {
  print("hello world!");
}
</dart>
<p>
Now let's take a look at this code and dissect the different elements.<br/>
First up, we will talk about functions. In a programming language, there are
essentially 2 things you need to work with: data and instructions. Functions
are a way to group up instructions, to keep them more organised and also to
make it easy to run a whole group of instructions at once.
</p>
<dart>
main() {

}
</dart>
<p>
This is how you define a function in Dart (very similar to most major
programming languages).  We see the name of the function, <code class='themable
function'>main</code>, followed by a pair of round brackets, and then curly
braces. The round brackets are always part of the function, both when you
define it and when you call it, so whenever you see round brackets in code with
a name in front of it, you can be sure it's a function.  The curly braces are
also important: they contain the instructions that will be executed when the
function is called. In this case, the function contains a single instruction:
</p>
<dart>
print("hello world!");
</dart>
<p>
Once more we see a name and some round brackets - but there are some
differences. This function does not have curly braces behind it, but a
semicolon instead. This is because we aren't defining the function, we are
calling it. The semicolon indicates that this is the end of the instruction.
</p><p>
We also see that the round brackets aren't empty, there is something in
quotation marks in between them. The things we put in between the brackets of a
function are called arguments, which are pieces of information given to a
function,and in this case the given information is called a <code
class='themable class'>String</code>.  A string is basically a piece of text
that needs to be treated literally, meaning that anything between the quotation
marks will not be interpreted as instructions.<br/>
</p><p>
As a whole, this instruction will call a function called <code class='themable
  function'>print</code> and pass it a string as argument. The <code
  class='themable function'>print</code> function is a built-in function of
Dart, which will take the argument you give it and print a text version of it
to the console. Since a string is already text, it will just print the text as
is. If you press the run button now, you get the expected result: the text "Hello, World!"
is printed to the console.
</p>
<h3>The <code>main</code> function</h3>
<p>
Throughout this course we will create a lot of functions, but there will always be exactly one function called <code>main</code>. This is because the program has to start somewhere, and in most languages, it starts by calling the main function. Not having a main function will break your program, so don't forget it!
