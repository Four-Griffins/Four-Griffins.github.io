<h2>Constructors</h2>
<p>
We have learnt about classes as a way to group data more conveniently, but if
the class contains a lot of properties, it's a lot of work to set them to the
desired values one by one. You could get around this by writing a function that
will automatically fill in all the properties of the class that you want to
fill in. Congratulations, you just reinvented constructors!
</p><p>
Constructors are, as the name suggests, functions meant to 'construct' the
object, in other words fill in the values for all the properties and do any
other setup that needs to be done before the object is usable. In Dart (and in
Java) they are written in a peculiar way: they have the
same name as the class itself (which means it starts with a capital) and they
don't return anything. Here is a class representing a two-dimentional point as
an example:
<dart>
class Point {
  double x = 0;
  double y = 0;

  Point(double newX, double newY) {
    x = newX;
    y = newY;
  }
}
</dart>
This code will work fine, and it will set the two coordinates. You even know
how to call this already: every time we created a class with
<code>&lt;classname&gt;()</code>, we are actually calling the constructor. (If
you don't write a constructor yourself, Dart will add one that doesn't take any
arguments.) So this is what it looks like with our custom constructor:
<dart>
main() {
  Point p = Point(2, 4);
}
</dart>
It mostly works like a normal function, except the capital, and the fact that
you don't return anything.
</p>
<h2>...But How About Some Nicer Code</h2>
<p>
The way I wrote this example above is... quite bad. There are various standards
of how to write constructors that I didn't follow, and we will go over them one
by one.
</p>
<h3>The <code class='themable keyword'>this</code> keyword</h3>
<p>
<code class='themable keyword'>this</code> is only used in classes. It's a
keyword that an instance can use to get a reference to itself. The main use is
when you have a property in a class that shares its name with an argument of a
function in that same class. By default, just putting in the name by itself
will prioritise the argument over the property (because it is in the inner
scope). By using <code class='themable keyword'>this</code>, you can access the
property as well. In our case this means that we don't have to come up with
weird names for the arguments of the constructor, we can just use the same
names as the properties we assign them to.
</p><dart>
class Point {
  double x = 0;
  double y = 0;

  Point(double x, double y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
</dart>
<h3>Automation!</h3>
<p>
This pattern emerges a lot, where you have an argument in the constructor, and
immediately pass it to a field with the same name. In fact, it's so common that
Dart provides a way to cut out the middleman: you can put the <code
class='themable keyword'>this</code>.<variable> directly between the brackets
of the constructor, and they will automagically be assigned to the properties.
<dart>
class Point {
  double x;
  double y;

  Point(this.x, this.y);
}
</dart>
Not only is this much cleaner, but it also solves another implicit problem:
note how I no longer need to give a value to <code class='themable
variable'>x</code> and <code class='themable variable'>y</code>, even though
<code class='themable class'>double</code> is not a nullable type. If you write
it this way, Dart knows that <code class='themable variable'>x</code> and <code
class='themable variable'>y</code> will always receive a value before they are
used, because the constructor will always be run before anything else. <br/>
On top of that, the constructor now has an empty body, and in such cases we are
allowed to leave out the brackets and replace them with a semicolon instead.
</p>
<h3>What if we need to calculate things?</h3>
<dart>
class Point {
  double x;
  double y;
  double? distanceToCenter;

  Point(this.x, this.y) {
    distanceToCenter = math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
  }
}
</dart>
<p>
What if I also want to store the distance to the point (0, 0)? This value is
not passed to the constructor but calculated, and that's a problem, because
Dart doesn't let me make it a non-nullable variable. However, in the case that
you don't want to deal with nullable variables, and you also don't want to come
up with a default value. For this specific case, there is actually a keyword:
<code class='themable keyword'>late</code>. It means that a variable will get a
value, but it will not be initialized using the <code class='themable
keyword'>this</code><code>.&lt;name&gt;</code> syntax. Be careful in using this
though, since you're basically giving up null safety: if the variable doesn't
get initialized correctly before it is used, the program will crash.
<dart>
class Point {
  double x;
  double y;
  late double distanceToCenter;

  Point(this.x, this.y) {
    distanceToCenter = math.sqrt(x*x + y*y);
  }
}
</dart>
<h3>Named Constructors</h3>
<p>
Dart doesn't allow for multiple functions with the same name, and constructors
are no exception. However, unlike normal functions, you can't exactly choose a
different name - it's a constructor, it <i>has</i> to have the same name as the
class. That's why the Dart developers chose to add <b>named constructors</b>, a
feature that not many other languages have, to solve this.
<dart>
class Point {
  late double x;
  late double y;

  Point(this.x, this.y);

  Point.horizontal(this.x) {
    this.y = 0;
  }

  Point.vertical(this.y) {
    this.x = 0;
  }
}

main() {
  Point a = Point(2, 3);
  Point b = Point.vertical(2.4);
  Point c = Point.horizontal(7);
}
</dart>
Maybe a dumb example, but you get the point: you can have multiple constructors
that initialize the object in a different way.
<div class='remark'>
  An example of a commonly used named constructor is <code class='themable
  class'>List</code>.<code class='themable function'>filled</code><code
  class='themable operator'>()</code>. Using the standard constructor <code
  class='themable class'>List</code><code class='themable operator'>()</code>
  has been discouraged for a while, and the <code class='themable
  class'>List</code> class offers a few named constructors that let you build
  and fill lists dynamically.
