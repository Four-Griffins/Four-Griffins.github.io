<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<p>
Up to this point, our program does the exact same thing every time. But that's
rarely the case for actual programs, they constantly change depending on the
input they receive. This is done through control flow operations.
</p>
<h3>The If Statement</h3>
<p>
First off, let's take a look at a very common use case: we want some code to
run only if a certain condition is met. This is done with the <code
class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement.
<dart>
if (<boolean expression>) {
  <instructions>
}
</dart>
As you can see, an <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement is very similar to a function, so make sure not to confuse them!
</p><p>
The &lt;boolean expression&gt; can be any expression that results in either <code class='themable literal'>true</code> or <code class='themable literal'>false</code>. If the result is <code class='themable literal'>true</code>, the instructions between the braces will be executed, and if the result is <code class='themable literal'>false</code> the whole block will be skipped. Time for an example!
<dart>
main() {
  int jerry = 17;
  int bert = 34;
  int sophie = 19;

  print("Jerry wants to enter");
  checkAge(jerry);

  print("Bert wants in too");
  checkAge(bert);

  print("Sophie as well");
  checkAge(sophie);
}

checkAge(int age) {
  if (age > 18) {
    print("You are old enough to enter!");
  }
}
</dart>
The <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement in the <code
  class='themable function'>checkAge</code> function has the condition
<code>age > 18</code>. First, we call the function with <code class='themable
  variable'>jerry</code>, who is 17, so <code class='themable
  variable'>age</code> gets the value 17. 17 is not greater than 18, so the
condition is <code class='themable literal'>false</code>, and the code block
with the <code class='themable function'>print</code> in it is not executed.
</p><p>
Then, we call <code class='themable function'>checkAge</code> again, this time
with 34. Since 34 is more than 18, the expression evaluates to <code
class='themable literal'>true</code>, and the whole block (including the <code class='themable
function'>print</code>) is executed.
</p>
<div class="themable remark">
  <h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
  It's good to know some operators that give a <code
    class='themable class'>bool</code> as a result, because there aren't that
  many of them and we will use them quite often. Here are some comparisons between numbers (<code class='themable class'>int</code> and <code class='themable class'>double</code>):
  <ul>
    <li>a == b: returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> if a and b are the same. Note the double equal signs, it doesn't work with a single sign, since that is already an assignment!</li>
    <li>a != b: returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> if a and b are not the same.</li>
    <li>a &gt; b: returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> if a is larger than b.</li>
    <li>a &gt;= b: the same as a &gt; b, but also returns true if a and b are the same.</li>
    <li>a &lt; b: returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> if a is smaller than b.</li>
    <li>a &lt;= b: the same as a &lt; b, but also returns true if a and b are the same.</li>
  </ul>
  And here are some things you can do with two <code class='themable class'>bool</code>s as arguments:
  <ul>
    <li>a && b: the <i>and</i> operator. Only returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> only if both a and b are true.</li>
    <li>a || b: the <i>or</i> operator. Returns <code class='themable literal'>true</code> if either a or b is <code class='themable literal'>true</code>, and also if both are <code class='themable literal'>true</code>.</li>
    <li>!a: the negation operator. It means the opposite of the given input, so if a is <code class='themable literal'>true</code>, then the result is <code class='themable literal'>false</code>, and vice versa.</li>
  </ul>
  These boolean operators are useful to check multiple conditions at the same time, for example to check if a number lies between 12 and 18:
  <dart>
if (age > 12 && age < 18) {
  print("You are a teenager!");
}
</dart>
</div>
</p>
<h3>What Else?</h3>
<p>
<code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statements are nice, but what if we
want the code to choose one of two paths based on a condition? This can be done
by putting one path in an <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement
that checks the condition, and then the other path in another <code
class='themable keyword'>if</code> that checks the opposite of the condition,
but this is not a good solution, especially when the condition is very
complicated or changes regularly while the program is being developed. For
that, there is simply the <code class='themable keyword'>else</code> keyword,
which goes behind an <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement.
<dart>
if (age > 18) {
  print("you are old enough to enter!");
} else {
  print("I'm sorry, but you are too young!");
}
</dart>
An <code class='themable keyword'>else</code> block can only come after an
<code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement, and it will only run when
the condition of that <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement is
<code class='themable literal'>false</code>. This means that - as the name
suggests - it will be executed only in the case that the <code class='themable
keyword'>if</code> statement is <b><i>not</i></b> executed. Think "if the
condition is true, execute this, else execute that".
</p>
<h3>Chaining With Else If</h3>
<p>
Next up are situations where something falls in one of a few categories, and we need to check which one exactly. With the tools we have now, this can be done as follows:
<dart>
if (age > 6) {
  print("toddler");
} else {
  if (age > 12) {
    print("child");
  } else {
    if (age > 20) {
      print("teenager");
    } else {
      if (age > 65) {
        print("adult");
      } else {
        print("senior");
      }
    }
  }
}
</dart>
As you can see, this becomes very messy very quickly when you add more cases.
Luckily, there's a better option. Instead of giving a block of curly braces to
<code class='themable keyword'>else</code>, you can give it another <code
class='themable keyword'>if</code> directly with a new condition. This way,
when the first <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> condition is false, the
code goes via the <code class='themable keyword'>else</code> straight to the
second <code class='themable keyword'>if</code>. When we do it like that, our
code becomes much easier to read:
<dart>
if (age > 6) {
  print("toddler");
} else if (age  12) {
  print("child");
} else if (age > 20) {
  print("teenager");
} else if (age > 65) {
  print("adult");
} else {
  print("senior");
}
</dart>
Okay, maybe not that much easier to read, but at least it's a lot more organised now.
</p>
<h3>Looping With While</h3>
<p>
<code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loops are an incredibly powerful tool to automate things within your code. Up
to this point, when we want output, we have to manually write the code that
produces it. But with loops, we can repeat code any amount of times, opening
the door to automatically generating lots of output!
</p><p>
It works like this: the <code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop, just
like the <code class='themable keyword'>if</code> statement, takes a condition
between round brackets, and then a block of code in curly braces. If the
condition is <code class='themable literal'>true</code>, the block is executed,
just like <code class='themable keyword'>if</code>, but then the condition is
checked again, and if it's still true the block is run again, and back to the
condition, and so on. The <code class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop
keeps executing it's block of code, checking the condition every cycle, until
the condition becomes <code class='themable keyword'>false</code>. Then it
stops, and the code continues after the loop.
<dart>
int counter = 0;
while (counter < 5) {
  print(counter);
  counter = counter + 1;
}
print("we are done with the loop!");
/* output:
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   we are done with the loop!
*/
</dart>
</p>
<div class='themable remark'>
<h3>Infinite Loops</h3>
This raises an important problem - what if the condition never becomes <code
  class='themable literal'>false</code>? The answer depends on where you run
the code. On the locally installed version of Dart, the program will hang
forever and likely pin one of the cores of your CPU to 100&percnt; usage, until
you forcefully stop it. If you run it on DartPad, it will freeze the website
for a while. Always be careful when creating loops! ;)
</div>
<h3>Break and Continue</h3>
<p>
Sometimes, your condition is quite complicated, too complicated to put into a
single boolean expression. For those cases, there are two handy features in the
form of <code class='themable keyword'>break</code> and <code class='themable
keyword'>continue</code>. When a <code class='themable keyword'>break</code>
statement is reached, the program will immediately stop the loop, and jump to
the next code after the loop. The <code class='themable
keyword'>continue</code> on the other hand, doesn't stop the entire loop, but
only the current iteration - i.e. the program jumps back from the <code
class='themable keyword'>continue</code> to the condition of the <code
class='themable keyword'>while</code> loop. You could think of it like this:
both <code class='themable function'>break</code> and <code class='themable
keyword'>continue</code> jump back to the top, to check the loop condition.
<code class='themable keyword'>continue</code> evaluates the condition
normally, but <code class='themable keyword'>break</code> always assumes the
condition is <code class='themable literal'>false</code>, and thus continues
the program below the loop.
<dart>
main() {
  int index = 0;
  while (true) {
    if (index == 3) {
      continue;
    }
    if (index == 7) {
      break;
    }

    print(index);
  }
}
/* output:
   0
   1
   2
   4
   5
   6
*/
</dart>
</p>

<h3>Well Done!</h3>
<p>
Phew, that was a long chapter! There is still more to be told about loops, but
i think it's a good idea to bring some variation and talk about something else
first, so the next chapter is going to be about classes instead.
