<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <span style="color: #298047">Four_Griffin's</span> coding class!
On this website you can find all the things that I taught in the coding streams
on the Discord server, as well as a bunch of exercises to practice those things
you learnt. On top of that, this introduction page will explain a few things
that will be important before you get started.
</p>

<h3>The tools</h3>
<p>
All the examples and exercises used in this course are in
<a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a>, a programming language
designed by Google for use in their UI platform called
<a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank">Flutter</a>.  If that sounds like
gibberish to you, that's fine.  The important thing to know is that Dart was
made to be fast, understandable and predictable, and it adopted its design from
a variety of well-known and established programming languages. This means that
if you learn things in Dart, you will easily be able to switch to almost any
language, since a lot of the concepts are fundamentally the same.
</p>
<p>
There is another good reason to use Dart: there is an online codepad available,
located at <a href="https://dartpad.dev" target="_blank">dartpad.dev</a>. A
codepad is an online code editor that allows you to write and run code right in
your browser, without having to install anything. That makes it easy for anyone
to follow along, just go to <a href="https://dartpad.dev"
target="_blank">dartpad.dev</a> and get started!
</p>
<p>
That said, maybe you would still like to install Dart on your computer; for
example to make programs that ask for input, or programs that read or write
files. To do this, you need to head over to the <a href="https://dart.dev/get-dart"
target="_blank">dart.dev install manual</a> and follow the instructions for
your operating system. Be assured though, by default my examples and exercises
will not use anything that can't be done with Dartpad, and if you need a local
install of Dart, the exercise will explicitly tell you.
</p>

<h3>The Dartpad interface</h3>
<p>
Since we are going to use Dartpad as a learning tool, let's take a quick look
at its layout. I've included the website below for you to test out (yes, it's
not a screenshot, you can actually use this included page to play around).
</p>

<p>
On the left side is the most important part of Dartpad: the code editor. If you
haven't used Dartpad yet, it probably contains a simple example program. (If
not, click on the 'examples' button in the top right, and pick the first one.)
Have you noticed how the text looks? A monospaced font and a lot of colors.
This is standard when it comes to coding. The point of the colors is to make it
easier to navigate and to recognise the different parts of the program, and the
monospaced font is for the sake of lining things up more easily, as well as
making certain special characters like semicolons easier to see.
</p>
<p>
There is a bright blue 'Run' button in the top right corner of the editor.
Go on, press it. The code on the left will be run and the result will be printed
out to the console on the right. The console is very easy to understand: it's just
the place where your program's output goes, in the form of text. Right below the 
console is a handy documentation window. If ou go to the editor and click on the word
<code style="color: rgb(0, 170, 210);">print</code> on the third line of code,
the documentation window will show you a summary of what the function does and
how you can use it.
</p>
<p>
There are some more buttons, but most of them aren't important to us. The
null-safety switch will be explained later, in one of the future chapters.
The format button is used to quickly arrange your code the way most programmers do it,
for example it will make code between curly braces have an extra tab compared to
the braces. The reset and new pad buttons aren't very useful, it's quicker to just
select all the code in the editor and delete it. And lastly, the top right has
an example button that shows some cool things you can do with Dart (although a
lot of them are in Flutter).
</p>

<h3>Comparing Dart to other languages</h3>
<p>
As I said earlier, Dart was made to be predictable, and thus the way it looks
is very similar to other languages, to make it easier for people with a
background in those languages to get started with Dart.  It might be
interesting to take a look at the syntax of Dart, and the history behind why it
came to be that way. Beware though, this paragraph will contain a fair bit
of technical jargon and none of it is critical information, so feel free to skip it.
</p>
<p>
Dart very closely follows the basic syntax of Java, which itself was derived
from C and C++. The most obvious common elements are the use of curly braces
<code>{}</code> to indicate blocks of code and define scope, and the period
to access the members of a class. Dart is also strongly typed, which means that
all variables need to be given a datatype, and they can only store data of that
type.  Dart does not have pointers or memory management, instead it uses a
garbage collector.  And of course Dart is an object-oriented language, just
like Java, making use of classes and inheritance.
</p>
<p>
In fact, Dart is so similar to Java that it might be more useful to highlight
the important differences.  The first big difference is how the program is run.
Java is meant to be compiled to bytecode, which needs to run on a virtual
machine (the so-called JVM or Java Virtual Machine) on top of the actual
computer.  Dart however has more options. It can be directly interpreted by the
Dart VM as a script, similar to e.g. Python code, it can be compiled to a
binary executable file that can be run by the computer directly without the
need for a virtual machine, and it can even be cross-compiled to Javascript and
run as a web-application!
</p>
<p>
Another big difference is null-safety, which will be covered in a later
chapter. The lack of null safety is a bit of an oversight in the design of
Java, but now it's too late to change this, since too many programs expect Java
to not be null-safe. Luckily Dart learned from the mistakes of the past and
includes null-safety by default.
</p>
<p>
Since Dart was made with UI design in mind, it has very solid async-await support
out of the box. Java technically has that as well, but it's more of an afterthought,
unlike in Dart where it was really added as a core feature deeply embedded into the
language.
</p>
<p>
And lastly: Java is very strict in being object-oriented, forcing you always
use classes for programs. Dart is a bit more loose and allows for variables and
functions outside of classes.
</p>

<h3>Enough rambling</h3>
<p>
If you read that whole thing, consider me impressed. This intro is not very
important for the actual class, and I got carried away writing about Dart
versus other languages.  Now you get to DM me on Discord to tell me that you
are a very thorough student :P<br/> In any case, this will do for an introduction.
Let's get started with the basics of a Dart program!
