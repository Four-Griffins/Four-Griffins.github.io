<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>
We already talked about functions briefly, but let's now take a deeper look. The template for a new function is like this:
<dart>
<name>() {

}
</dart>
<div class='themable remark'>The name of the function is in camelCase, just like variables.</div>
</p>
<h3>Arguments</h3>
<p>
Functions can take arguments. This can be used to change the exact way the
function works, or to pass through data that the function uses to do things.
Here is a simple example:
<dart>
main() {
  greet("Bert");
  greet("Ernie");
}

greet(String friend) {
  print("A warm welcome to...");
  print(friend);
}
</dart>
Here, the function <code class="themable function">greet</code> takes 1
argument of type <code class="themable class">String</code> and we give it the
name <code class="themable variable">friend</code>. Note how it looks almost
exactly like creating a variable normally, except we don't give it a value.
This is because the value is assigned the moment the function is called, like
in this example where we pass the value <code class="themable string">"Bert"
</code> and then <code class='themable string'>"Ernie"</code>.
</p><p>
The first time the function is called, the argument <code class='themable
string'>"Bert"</code> is passed between the brackets. This is a <code class='themable class'>
String</code>, so this doesn't give any errors. <code class="themable
function">greet</code> is then executed with the <code class="themable
variable">friend</code> variable set to <code class="themable
string">"Bert"</code>. It prints <code>A warm welcome to...</code>
followed by <code>Bert</code>. After that we reach the end of the <code
class='themable function'>greet</code> function, so we go back to <code
class='themable function'>main</code>.
</p><p>
Immediately after, <code class='themable function'>greet</code> is called
again, but this time the <code class='themable variable'>friend</code> argument
receives the value <code class='themable string'>"Ernie"</code>. So
when executing, it now prints <code>A warm welcome to... Ernie</code> instead.
</p><p>
Functions can take any amount of arguments, and they don't have to be of the
same type. If you really need to, you can make very long functions, like this
monstrosity from the Flutter framework.
<dart>
createLabelWrap(String label, int itemCount, Button childButton, Padding padding, Margins margins, bool hasBorder, bool scrollable, bool isFilled, Color fillColor) {
  // I omitted the actual code, it's quite complicated
}
</dart>
If you have more than one argument, don't forget to separate them with commas!
</p>
<h3>Return Types</h3>
<p>
That's great and all, but what if we want to make a function do something,
<i>and get back the result</i>? That is done through <b>return types</b>. Let's
consider this function that adds 2 numbers:
<dart>
main() {
  add(2, 3);
  // how do we retrieve the result here?
}

add(int a, int b) {
  int sum = a + b;
}
</dart>
We need to do 2 things. First, we of course need to specify the data type of
the variable we want to return. In this case, we want to return an <code
class='themable class'>int</code>. This is specified by putting the data type
(in this context, we call it the 'return type') in front of the function name:
<dart>
int add(int a, int b) {
  int sum = a + b;
}
</dart>
If you try this in DartPad, you will notice it's giving us a warning. That's
because we promised to return an <code class='themable class'>int</code>, but
we haven't returned anything yet! To return the calculated sum, we have to use
the <code class='themable keyword'>return</code> keyword, followed by an
expression that resolves to a value of our return type. We can simply use the
<code class='themable variable'>sum</code> variable we created.
<dart>
int add(int a, int b) {
  int sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
</dart>
Since <code class='themable keyword'>return</code> accepts expressions, we can
even write this shorter, since <code>a + b</code> resolves to an <code
class='themable class'>int</code>:<dart>
int shorterAdd(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
</dart>

<div class="themable remark">If you don't specify any return type, there is a
  default data type called <code class='themable keyword'>void</code>. This
  type means that the function returns no value at all. So far none of the
  examples had a return type, so Dart automatically assumes we don't return
  anything and fills in the <code class='themable keyword'>void</code> behind
  the scenes. For example, you can write the main function like this as well:
  <dart>
void main() {

}
</dart>
</div>
