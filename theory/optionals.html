<h2>Optional Arguments</h2>
<p>
Time to talk about a feature that is pretty specific to Dart. Optional
arguments are exactly what you think they are - arguments for functions that
are optional, meaning that you can choose to leave them out. The reason why
Google chose to make these an important feature of Dart, is because straight
from the beginning Dart was meant to be used for graphical interfaces. A lot of
functions of graphical components have a ridiculous amount of customisation
options, all of which you can specify through arguments. If you had to write
every argument every time, your code would look really messy.
</p>
<h3>But First: Function Overloading</h3>
<p>
But even before Dart was created, languages had need of optional arguments
sometimes. This course is meant to not just teach you about Dart, but about
programming in general, so I would be a bad teacher if I didn't mention this.
;)<br/> The most common way to do this is called <i>function overloading</i>.
In short, the following code would be valid Java code:
<dart>
public void saveToFile(String data) {
  // save the data to the default file
}

public void saveToFile(int data) {
  // save the number to the default file
}

public void saveToFile(String data, File file) {
  // save the data to the given file
}
</dart>
Do you see it? Just ignore the 'public' for a moment - that's just how Java
works - but notice how all these functions have the same name! How is this not
an error? Because all of them have different types of arguments. The first
function takes a <code class='themable class'>String</code>, the second one an
<code class='themable class'>int</code>, and the third one a <code
class='themable class'>String</code> and a <code class='themable
class'>File</code>. If you were to call any of them like this:
<dart>
saveToFile(3427582);
</dart>
Java sees the integer value and knows to pick the version of <code
class='themable function'>saveToFile</code> that takes an <code class='themable
class'>int</code>. So as long as all the versions of the function have
different types of arguments, it works.
</p>
<h3>The Dart Way</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately Dart doesn't have this functionality: every function needs a
unique name (at least in the same scope). Luckily we have optional arguments!
Let's say we want to make a function for accessing a webpage.
<dart>
main() {
  search("cute dogs");
  search("cute dogs", "google.com");
  search("cute dogs", "google.com", 8080);
}

search(String searchTerm, [String site = "duckduckgo.com", int port = 443]) {
  // fetch the webpage here
}
</dart>
Once again we use the square brackets. Be careful though, this is not a list,
don't confuse them! A list contains values, but the optional parameters between
the square brackets are variables. However, since they may or may not receive a
value from the code that calls them, they might be <code class='themable
literal'>null</code> - which we can't allow since they are non-nullable types.
That's why you need to give them a default value, in the same way that you
assign a value to a normal variable. If the calling code doesn't provide a
value for the optional argument, the default is used, but if there <i>is</i> a
value provided, it will overwrite the default.
</p>
<h3>Named Arguments Are Better</h3>
<p>
Optional arguments are cool, but they have a very big drawback. Imagine that
you want to use the <code class='themable function'>search</code> from above,
but you only want to specify the search term and the port, not the site. But if
you try this, you get an error!
<dart>
search("cute dogs", 8080);
// Error: the argument type "int" can't be assigned to the parameter type "String"
</dart>
Because Dart sees one optional value and tries to assign it to the first
optional argument. We need a way to say which value is for which argument - and
lucky for us, this exists. Instead of using normal optional parameters, use
named parameters.
<dart>
main() {
  search("cute dogs");
  search("cute dogs", site: "google.com");
  search("cute dogs", site: "google.com", port: 8080);
  search("cute dogs", port: 8080);
}

search(String searchTerm, {String site = "duckduckgo.com", int port = 443}) {
  // fetch the webpage here
}
</dart>
Very similar to optional arguments, but this time the optional section of the
arguments is enclosed in curly braces, not rectangular ones. On top of that,
now we have to specify the name of the argument that we want to bind every
value to. The benefit of this is that we can specify any combination of named
arguments in any order (except the mandatory ones, those still go first).
</p><p>
One place that makes a lot of use of this syntax is Flutter. For example, the
function to create a pop-up dialog could be called like this:
<dart>
showDialog(
  context: buildContext,
  builder: () => warningDialog,
  useSafeArea: true,
  barrierDismissible: true,
  barrierColor: Color.fromArgb(0, 200, 200, 180)
);
</dart>
There's some things in there that you don't know, but those are besides the
point. Just focus on how nicely organised and understandable this code is: not
a meaningless list of <code class='themable literal'>true</code>s and <code
class='themable literal'>false</code>s, it says what they do right there in the name.
