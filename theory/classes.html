<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>
So far I haven't talked about classes, despite them being a core part of almost
any language after the invention of Java. High time to get started then! A
basic class looks like this:
<dart>
class Person {

}
</dart>
This defines a class called <code class='themable class'>Person</code>. What do
we use it for, I hear you ask? Well, classes are another tool to organise
logical parts of code, by allowing classes to contain both variables and
functions. This way, classes are a decent abstractions of real-life objects: a
real person has information (like their name, age, gender, or current job) and
have 'functions' (eat food, say something, take 10 steps forward). By making
classes represent objects, it becomes easier to imagine how the different parts
of the program interact with each other. 
<dart>
class Person {
  String name = "";
  int energy = 100;

  greet() {
    print("hello! My name is" + name);
  }

  doTask(int energyCost) {
    energy = energy - energyCost;
  }
}
</dart>
<div class="themable remark">
  Variables declared inside a class like this are called "properties" or "fields".
</div>
The <code class='themable class'>Person</code> class now has 2 properties and 2
functions: every <code class='themable class'>Person</code> has a name and some
energy, and they can say a greeting or perform a task, which takes some of
their energy away. Now let's see how we can actually use this class. A class is
basically a data type, so now we can create variables of type <code
class='themable class'>Person</code>, in much the same way as how we created
variables of type <code class='themable class'>int</code> before.<br>Now, how
do we create values of type <code class='themable class'>Person</code>?
<dart>
main() {
  Person adam = Person();
}
</dart>
Be careful not to forget the round brackets after the <code class='themable
class'>Person</code>; we will learn why they are there in a later chapter. When
creating a variable that has some <code class='themable keyword'>class</code>
as its type, this variable is called an <b>instance</b> of the class, or an
object of that type. So in the example code above, <code>adam</code> is an
instance of the class <code class='themable class'>Person</code>. This is a
tricky but important thing to understand though: <i>properties and functions
  belong to instances of a class, not the class itself</i>. I cannot access the
<code class="themable variable">name</code> of the <code class='themable
class'>Person</code> class, or call its <code class='themable
function'>greet</code> function.  However, when I created the instance <code
class='themable variable'>adam</code>, it receives its own <code
class='themable variable'>name</code> and <code class='themable
function'>greet</code> and so on.  Therefore, calling the <code class='themable
function'>greet</code> of one instance might have a completely different result
than the <code class='themable function'>greet</code> of another instance,
because the two functions might use properties that are different for the two
instances.
</p>
<h3>The Dot Operator</h3>
<p>
After creating an object, we would of course like to access its properties
and functions. For that we use the dot operator: type the name of the variable,
then a period, and then the name of the property or function you want. The dot
operator is also the only one that we don't put spaces around.
<dart>
main() {
  Person adam = Person();
  adam.name = "Adam";
  adam.greet();

  Person bella = Person();
  bella.name = "Bella";
  bella.greet();
}
</dart>
</p>
